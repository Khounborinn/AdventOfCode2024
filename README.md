This repository is for Advent of Code 2024.

All of the code will be done in Python, and I will not be including my input data.
Some notable points about my code:
- It may not be the cleanest (I am not a Python developer)
- I will try my best to follow the PEP8 guidelines
- My intention of participating is to further learn about the capbabilities of Python
